Profile

Backend-focused software engineer with 7+ years building data analytics systems in regulated healthcare environments. Most of my professional work has involved handling sensitive data (PHI) under HIPAA and GDPR, where correctness, auditability, and explicit constraints matter more than speed or novelty.

I’m particularly interested in systems that:

enforce hard boundaries instead of relying on trust

fail clearly instead of guessing

prioritise correctness over confidence

Outside of work, I build side projects to explore AI-adjacent system design, failure modes, and refusal patterns in more depth than day-to-day product work allows.

Earlier Career (Pre-Software)

Before returning to education, I spent over a decade in IBM manufacturing and logistics, including team leadership roles. This background shaped how I think about process discipline, failure modes, and operational responsibility — skills I now apply in software engineering.
